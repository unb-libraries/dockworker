{{ '##' }} Deploy, Develop in this Application Yourself!
Local deployment, development and testing is accelerated via [dockworker](https://github.com/unb-libraries/dockworker), our unified framework of [Robo](https://robo.li/) commands that streamline local development of our application on Linux or OSX.

{{ '###' }} Step 1: Install Dockworker Dependencies
In your local development environment, several 'one time' dependency installations are required to deploy all applications with dockworker. Some or all of these may already be installed in your environment.

* [PHP7](https://php.org/)
* PHP Extensions : php-curl php-dom php-gd php-mbstring php-posix php-yaml php-zip
* [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* [docker](https://www.docker.com): Installation steps [are located here](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/): Installation steps [are located here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

{{ '###' }} Step 2: Deploy
With all dependencies installed, you are ready to deploy any of our applications locally and and begin development:

```
composer install
vendor/bin/dockworker deploy
```

And that's it! The application will build and deploy in your local environment.

If you work with unb-libraries applications often, you may also consider [installing a dockworker alias](https://gist.github.com/JacobSanford/1448fece856be371060d0f16ccb1b194), which avoids referencing vendor/bin for each dockworker command.
