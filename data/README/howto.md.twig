{{ '##' }} Deploy this Application Yourself!
Local deployment, development and testing of {{ instance_name }} is easy, as we leverage [dockworker](https://github.com/unb-libraries/dockworker), our unified framework of [Robo](https://robo.li/) commands that streamline local development of our application on Linux or OSX.

{{ '###' }} Step 1: Install Dockworker's Dependencies
In your local development environment, a minimal number of 'one time' dependencies are required to deploy applications with dockworker. Some or all of these may already be installed in your environment; see the list of dependencies and installation instructions [here](https://github.com/unb-libraries/dockworker/blob/4.x/docs/prerequisites.md).

{{ '###' }} Step 2: Deploy
With all dependencies installed, you are ready to deploy any of our applications locally and and begin development:

```
composer install
vendor/bin/dockworker deploy
```

And that's it! The application will build and deploy in your local environment.

If you work with unb-libraries applications often, you may also consider [installing a dockworker alias](https://gist.github.com/JacobSanford/1448fece856be371060d0f16ccb1b194), which avoids referencing vendor/bin for each dockworker command.
