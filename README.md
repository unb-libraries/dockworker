# DockWorker
## Build, Develop, Deploy... Better
Dockworker provides web application developers, site builders and operational engineers a single technical entrypoint with a consistent, unified workflow regardless of the framework.

Dockworker was borne out of the desire to improve developer experience by spinning-up local development via a *single command on any workstation*. Since then, it has evolved into a tool that streamlines many elements of our web product lifecycles.

The package is not useful on its own. For an example of how we use dockworker every day, check out how we  [develop and deploy our main web application at UNB Libraries](https://github.com/unb-libraries/lib.unb.ca).

## Features
* Minimizes local workstation development dependencies.
* Reduces dependency on developer knowledge of operations technology.
* Provides a 'single command' development spin-up.
* Tests contribution code standard and quality compliance.
* Synchronizes data between development and production environments.
* Configures and controls the CI / deployment process.
* Eases interaction with framework tools (Drupal/Drush, etc).
* Standardizes README, LICENSE files across repositories.

## Releases
Dockworker releases are tagged according to semantic versioning. We add features to the product often, and deprecate quickly. Major releases will introduce backwards-incompatible changes.
