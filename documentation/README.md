# Introduction
 Dockworker is a Unix command line scripting interface that provides web application developers, site builders and operational engineers a single technical entrypoint with a consistent, unified workflow regardless of the framework.

Dockworker was borne out of the desire to improve developer experience by spinning-up local development via a *single command on any workstation*. Since then, it has evolved into a tool that streamlines many elements of our web product lifecycles.

The package is not useful on its own. For an example of how we use dockworker every day, check out how we  [develop and deploy our main web application at UNB Libraries](https://github.com/unb-libraries/lib.unb.ca).
